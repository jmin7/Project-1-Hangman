# Project-1-Hangman

##  [Project description] ##

 Hangman game with 7 chances to guess the word. Once the word for the game is chosen, each letter is shown in blank.
 Player starts guessing by clicking the alphabet button. If the guess is right, the letter will appear instead of blank space. If wrong, system draws a hangman. Once a letter is clicked, the button becomes unclickable so the user can't guess the same letter twice.
If the player reveals all of the hidden letters before reaching 7 incorrect guesses, then the user wins.
The game shows score and score can be cleared by the 'refresh score' button.
