# Project-1-Hangman

##  [Project description] ##

 Hangman game with 7 chances to guess the word. Once the word for the game is chosen, each letter is shown in a blank. 
 Player starts guessing by clicking the alphabet button. If the guess is right, the letter will appear instead of blank space, if wrong system draws a hangman. After a letter is used, button is unclickable so the user will not try to guess the same letter twice. 
If the player reveals all of the hidden letters before reaching 7 incorrect guesses, then the user wins. 
While the player is same, system shows score by counting numbers of winning. 
New player button will refresh everything including the score and start a new game.
